		"Text" : "Along the edge of Money Road, across from the railroad tracks, an old grocery store rots. In August 1955, a 14-year-old black boy visiting from Chicago walked in to buy candy. After being accused of whistling at the white woman behind the counter, he was later kidnapped, tortured, lynched and dumped in the Tallahatchie River. The murder of Emmett Till is remembered as one of the most hideous hate crimes of the 20th century, a brutal episode in American history that helped kindle the civil rights movement. And the place where it all began, Bryant’s Grocery & Meat Market, is still standing. Barely. Today, the store is crumbling, roofless and covered in vines. On several occasions, preservationists, politicians and business leaders — even the State of Mississippi — have tried to save its remaining four walls. But no consensus has been reached. Some residents in the area have looked on the store as a stain on the community that should be razed and forgotten. Others have said it should be restored as a tribute to Emmett and a reminder of the hate that took his life. As the debate has played out over the decades, the store has continued to deteriorate and collapse, even amid frequent cultural and racial reckonings across the nation on the fate of Confederate monuments. At stake in Money and other communities across the country is the question of how Americans choose to acknowledge the country’s past. “It’s part of this bigger story, part of a history that we can learn from,” said the Rev. Wheeler Parker, 79, a pastor in suburban Chicago and a cousin of Emmett’s who went with him to Bryant’s Grocery that day. “The store should be one of the places we share Emmett’s story.”",

		"Text" : "In this work, we study the internal representations of GANs. To a human observer, a well-trained GAN appears to have learned facts about the objects in the image: for example, a door can appear on a building but not on a tree. We wish to understand how a GAN represents such structure. Do the objects emerge as pure pixel patterns without any explicit representation of objects such as doors and trees, or does the GAN contain internal variables that correspond to the objects that humans perceive? If the GAN does contain variables for doors and trees, do those variables cause the generation of those objects, or do they merely correlate? How are relationships between objects represented? By carefully examining representation units, we have found that many parts of GAN representations can be interpreted, not only as signals that correlate with object concepts but as variables that have a causal effect on the synthesis of objects in the output. These interpretable effects can be used to compare, debug, modify, and reason about a GAN model. Our method can be potentially applied to other generative models such as VAEs  and RealNVP.",

		"Text" : "Following Cas9 cleavage, DNA repair without a donor template is generally considered stochastic, heterogeneous and impractical beyond gene disruption. Here, we show that template-free Cas9 editing is predictable and capable of precise repair to a predicted genotype, enabling correction of disease-associated mutations in humans. We constructed a library of 2,000 Cas9 guide RNAs paired with DNA target sites and trained inDelphi, a machine learning model that predicts genotypes and frequencies of 1- to 60-base-pair deletions and 1-base-pair insertions with high accuracy (r = 0.87) in five human and mouse cell lines. inDelphi predicts that 5–11% of Cas9 guide RNAs targeting the human genome are ‘precise-50’, yielding a single genotype comprising greater than or equal to 50% of all major editing products. We experimentally confirmed precise-50 insertions and deletions in 195 human disease-relevant alleles, including correction in primary patient-derived fibroblasts of pathogenic alleles to wild-type genotype for Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome and Menkes disease. This study establishes an approach for precise, template-free genome editing.",

		"Text" : "States and the federal government should also pass far tougher regulations on the gun industry, particularly through restrictions on the marketing of guns, which have helped supercharge the cult of the AR-15. New York’s law, which allows parties like victims of gun violence and the state government to sue gun sellers, manufacturers and distributors, is a good model for other states to follow. Federal regulators should also do more to regulate the arms industry’s marketing practices, which are becoming more deadly and deranged by the year. They have the legal authority to do so but, thus far, not the will to act. Americans are going to live with a lot of guns for a long time. There are already more than 415 million guns in circulation, including 25 million semiautomatic military-style rifles. Calls for confiscating them — or even calls for another assault weapons ban — are well intentioned and completely unrealistic. With proper care and maintenance, guns made today will still fire decades from now. Each month, Americans add nearly two million more to the national stockpile. But even if common-sense regulation of guns is far from political reality, Americans do not have to accept the worst of gun culture becoming pervasive in our politics. The only hope the nation has for living in and around so many deadly weapons is a political system capable of resolving our many differences without the need to use them.",

		"Text" : "As a child, we are often told to be happy with what we have and to not ask for more. While a great personal finance strategy, this does not carry over to revolutionary movements. In Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, Offred attempts to challenge Gilead’s social hierarchy through small acts of rebellion; the complacency she develops from these actions pushes her away from making true change. Atwood may suggest that movements against totalitarianism as a whole grow complacent at small victories, failing to challenge the status quo. Offred’s challenge of Gilead’s social hierarchy manifests in small, forbidden expressions of individual freedom. When asked to play Scrabble with the Commander, she is challenging her spot on the hierarchy as a submissive handmaid by reading, a privilege reserved only for powerful men. Offred herself admits that the game itself is stupid, but she partakes in it to feel a sense of freedom. While her game is technically an act of resistance, it is one with no substance. The mere fact that she is disobeying the hierarchy is enough to give Offred a feeling of freedom. But her actions fail to make any real change, both in society and her position. When the commander asks Offred to put on lingerie and visit a brother, she has no desire to do so, but knows that the Commander’s position of power leaves her no choice. Even after she has done so much for the Commander, her social standing has remained the same. Her previous challenges to the hierarchy have made no difference, and were not acts of real resistance. The power the commander has over Offred shows that her challenges were only possible because those with more power enabled them. Offred attempts to resist the social hierarchy through her expression of freedom. However, these challenges make no real change, and are only enabled by those who benefit from the hierarchy she attempts to resist.",

		"Text" : "Benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has enabled the monitoring and optimization of chemical transformations while simultaneously providing kinetic, mechanistic, and structural insight into reaction pathways with quantitative precision. Moreover, benchtop NMR proton lock capabilities further allow for rapid and convenient monitoring of various organic reactions in real-time, as the use of deuterated solvents is not required. The complementary role of 19F NMR-based kinetic monitoring in the fluorination of bioactive compounds serves many benefits in the drug discovery process, since fluorinated motifs additionally improve drug pharmacology. In this study, 19F NMR spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the synthesis of novel trifluorinated analogs of monastrol, a small molecule dihydropyrimidine kinesin-Eg5 inhibitor, and to probe the mechanism of the Biginelli cyclocondensation, a multicomponent reaction used to synthesize dihydropyrimidine and tetrahydropyrimidines through a Bronsted- or Lewis-acid catalyzed cyclocondensation between ethyl acetoacetate, thiourea, and an aryl aldehyde. In the present study, a trifluorinated ketoester serves a dual purpose as being the source of the trifluoromethyl group in our fluorinated dihydropyrimidines and as a spectroscopic handle for real time reaction monitoring and tracking of reactive intermediates by 19F NMR. Further, upon extending this workflow to a diverse array 3- and 4-substituted aryl aldehydes, we were able to derive Hammett linear free energy relationships (LFER) to determine stereoelectronic effects of para- and meta- substituted aryl aldehydes to corresponding reaction rates and mechanistic routes. In addition, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to corroborate our experimental results through the thermodynamic values of key intermediates in each mechanism. Finally, these studies cumulate in the synthesis of a novel trifluorinated analog of monastrol and its subsequent biological evaluation in vitro. More broadly, we show an application of benchtop 19F NMR spectroscopy as an analytical tool in the real-time investigation of a mechanistically and chemically complex multicomponent reaction mixture.",

		"Text" : "For nearly three months, protests have gripped Iran — protests that have not only been surprisingly durable, but also led primarily by women. On Thursday, the Islamic Republic, headed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, executed 23-year-old Mohsen Shekari for the crime of “waging war against God,” or moharebeh in Farsi. Shekari was the first prisoner to be executed due to the recent unrest, in what head of the Norway-based organization Iran Human Rights Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam told the BBC was a “show trial without any due process.” With Shekari’s execution — likely the first of dozens — the Iranian regime is reverting to a tried and tested playbook of executing political opponents and dissidents. But it’s not clear that the mass imprisonment, extrajudicial killings, and further possible state-sanctioned executions will deter the protesters who have for more than two months now defied crackdowns and curfews to call for an end to Khamenei’s regime.",

But interviewing Raul, a 32-year-old janitor at Google Headquarters, and seeing how Google forced him to move far away from a job he was forced to quit and pull his daughter out of school turned those statistics into real people with real struggles. Though Raul’s individual account was never published, our larger story on evictions inspired protests from the community and the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging the order in court.

		"Text" : "The HMS Illustrious belched smoke as it began to list to port. First Lieutenant Neil Rudkin swore as he coughed smoke out of his lungs, trying to make out something, anything, in the engine room of the dying ship. The engine room, he thought. The goddamn engine room. Of all the places to be at this moment. Filth, grime, and other mystery substances covered the wall. Smoke belched from various vents, suffocating those who were unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity. Better to die quickly than slowly suffocate in this filthy, disgusting, obscene overglorified coffin, he thought, wheezing, as he trudged toward the doorway. The Illustrious was the last carrier in the fleet, and one of the only remaining vessels in the navy. Since the War in the Pacific came to a close and the Soviet Union had all but fallen, the once mighty Home Fleet was under constant attack from the Kriegsmarine. Rudkin cleared his lungs again and bolted up the stairway to the deck. Damn, he thought as he gasped for air, wheezing, belching smoke, already running again as an artillery shell obliterated the spot he had just been standing in. Explosions erupted all across the deck runway. Evacuation sirens blared, swordfish torpedo bombers roared off the deck, gun crews rushed to their stations, or what were left of them, anyway. A Sikorsky H-5, or at least what might have been one, skidded down the deck before exploding in a mess of steel and shrapnel. German 16-pounder guns hammered at the deck, destroying most aircraft before their pilots even reached them, the wrecks of the fighters littering the deck. Rudkin ran toward a lifeboat, his eardrums at breaking point as anti-aircraft batteries opened up on German torpedo bombers. ",
